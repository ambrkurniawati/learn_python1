#print
print("Hello World!")

#Variabels and Literals
number1 = 10 #number1 is variabels and 10 is literals
number2 = 5

#Operators
print(number1 * number5) #the output is 50

#SIMPLE CALCULATORS
#calculate the phone price. the base_price is 7500000, the discount is 15%, and the tax is 10%
#answer:
base_price = 7500000
discount = base_price*0.3
price_after_discount = base_price - discount
final_price = price_after_discount * 1.1 #1.1 is 100% + 10%
print(final_price)

#Data Type
1. Null (empty value)
2. Boolean (True or False)
3. Numeric (Integer (1, 2, 800, 450) and float (5.2, 7.8, 10.5))
4. Text ('', "")

#List[]
#mutable
contoh_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(contoh_list[2] # the output is 3
#change 4 to 6
contoh_list[3] = 6
print(contoh_list) #the output is [1, 2, 3, 6, 5]

#Tupple()
#same like list() but tupple is immutable

#Set{} is mutable
#frozenset is immutable
#set and frozenset doesn't allow a double data and careless about step.

#dictionary
dictionary = {"key" : "value"}
person = {'nama' : 'Ambar', 'position' : 'Data Analyst and Business Intelligence'
print(person['nama'])
print(person['position'])
